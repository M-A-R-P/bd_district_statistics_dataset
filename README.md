# Bangladesh District Statistics Dataset from Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics - 2011 Census

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Original PDF Source: [[bbs.gov.bd]](http://www.bbs.gov.bd/site/page/2888a55d-d686-4736-bad0-54b70462afda/District-Statistics)

In this project, we are trying to extract the PDF data and clean it to turn it into easily readable formats (such as CSV and JSON) to be used easily by everyone.

# Notebooks

1. [docx parser.ipynb](https://github.com/yasserius/bd_district_statistics_dataset/blob/main/docx%20parser.ipynb): The PDFs from BBS have been converted into docx files using Adobe Acrobat Pro, and in this notebook, the docx is opened and the paragraphs and tables are extracted, then saved in a pickle.

2. [processing content](https://github.com/yasserius/bd_district_statistics_dataset/blob/main/processing%20content.ipynb): the pickles are further processed to extract the contents of the paragraphs and tables.
